    <h3>Artist's Environment</h3>
    <h4>
      The student as an artist. In these last years, students had the
      opportunity to showcast their works for different types of classes. Most
      projects that will be showcased will be within the KABK walls. But this
      doesn't make it any less special! The galleries of the school are mainly
      used for presentation of works, and you have endless opportunities on how
      you would like to show your project. Going out in The Hague is definitely
      not something you want to miss out on.
