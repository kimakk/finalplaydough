        The Royal Academy of Art, is an art school since 1682
        that offers seven bachelor and seven master programmes. The Graphic
        Design bachelor's programme equips you to become a critical thinker and
        versatile practitioner who can develop concepts for visual
        communication. You will be encouraged to ask questions about the social
        responsibilities of a contemporary designer, tackle challenges posed by
        the rapidly evolving new-media landscape, and seek answers to the
        problems of tomorrow. The programme is built around the main subjects of
        Design, Interaction, Image, Coding and Typography, and numerous
        electives including Letterstudio, Design Research, Moving Image and
        Design Practice.

          <p>The first year is an adventurous exploration of your qualities in various aspects of graphic design. These qualities are explored with challenging assignments that appeal to the student’s curiosity and creativity. Considerable emphasis is placed on open-mindedness and the joy of working. You will try out different ways of working and acquire an initial indication of your visual abilities and the value of your ideas.

            You will gradually move towards the development of your own visual language and visions. In the first year, it is important to create a large body of work that provides confidence and creates resilience that will be useful during the rest of the programme.
            
            In the final assessment, you must answer the question of whether graphic design is suitable for you, and if you are suitable for the profession. You should be able to specify clearly the elements of the profession that are of primary interest to you..</p>

<h2>Where do I stand and what do I stand for? <br>
</h2>
    <div class="circle2">JWS</div>
    <div class="box1">
    With every
    important step in your life, you are faced, consciously or unconsciously,
    with the decision: do I want to take that step? Am I going to devote time,
    energy, money and other resources, attention, even love to it? What am I
    investing in my plan, my project, my artistic practice? 
  </div>
<div class="box2">It takes
  self-confidence just to dare to ask those questions: where do I want to go,
  along what path, and what freedom of choice do I actually have? It proves to
  be a difficult task for everyone, especially artists, to chart their own
  course, in terms of work, in choosing one's position and in how to behave
  towards others with respect to one's own work. Explicit, identifiable
  choices and, more often, implicit choices which present themselves more or
  less routinely on a path already taken, merge and overlap. </div>
  <div class="box3">The word
    'strategy' is a term that is used indiscriminately for fundamental life
    choices as well as-incorrectly-for practical actions which may be organised
    differently from one day to the next. It is wise to make a distinction, on
    the one hand between strategy (fundamental and focused on the long term)
    and, on the other, tactics (incidental and modifiable in the short term). I
    shall return to that distinction in 'Goals, 25 strategy and tactics'. To put
    the importance of charting a course into perspective, many an artist points
    to the impossibility of 'knowing every- thing beforehand', the inevitability
    of 'everything going differently', and the necessity of being receptive to
    the unexpected and the unpredictable. No choice means you are also making a
    choice anyway-by not choosing. Your own course plus the flexibility to
    improvise your reaction are two sides of the same coin: a conscious course
    offers the possibility to deviate purposively, improvisation provides
    experiences that simplify the charting of one's own course and the choice
    itself, in a circular process, with trial and error, is clarified.</div>
    <div class="box4">
      The art world fascinated me and I was shown that the possibilities of design are endless. You will be thrown into a bundle of mystery and doubt, of overwhelming fears and (un)satisfying results. Your choices that you make in the first year have to be all this - overwhelming, scary, uncomfortable and incredibly annoying sometimes. But this leads to learning so much more than when you stay in your bubble of comfort. Your internal artist will be challenged and in the first year you almost won’t feel the external art world creeping up on you.
